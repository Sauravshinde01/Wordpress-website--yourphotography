Welcome to Photo Shots! For our project we strived to establish a market that allows for photographers and customers to have an open line of communication and fulfill both of their needs. Allows the photographers to take specific requests and to also showcase what they can do in one central location rather than having to set up their own website.
We established our base on WordPress to utilize and capitalize on the plugins that they offer. The most important things that needed to be addressed were the database, Multi Factor Authentication and Payment Gateways. Along with this we established our home page, shop, and registration utilizing WordPress plugins such as Elementor, Forminator, and WooCommerce. The site is structured around the customer picking a type of photo that they want taken and then we will pair them with a photographer who will fit all of their needs. â€‹
